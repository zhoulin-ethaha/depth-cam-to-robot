# camera-to-robot

Turn any webcam image into a UR robot drawing. Point the camera at an object or sketch, click **Capture**, click **Run** — the robot traces every detected edge with a pen.

---

## Overview

`camera-to-robot` is a Python application that bridges computer vision and robot motion:

1. A webcam looks down at a flat surface (paper, whiteboard, sand…)
2. OpenCV's Canny edge detector extracts the outlines of whatever is in frame
3. The edges are turned into an ordered list of robot poses
4. A Universal Robots arm traces the path with a pen, using smooth `servoL` streaming at 125 Hz

All interaction happens in a browser-based UI that opens automatically. No ROS, no offline programming.

    │
    ▼
_order_strokes()              ← TSP nearest-neighbour; minimises pen-up travel
    │
    ▼

## Canny edge detection

### What it is

The **Canny edge detector** (John Canny, 1986) is a multi-stage algorithm that finds object boundaries in a greyscale image and outputs a 1-pixel-wide binary edge map. It is widely considered the gold standard for edge detection because it finds real edges while suppressing noise.

### The four stages

**1. Gaussian blur** (`CANNY_BLUR_KERNEL = 5`, a 5×5 kernel)

Smooths the image before gradient computation. Camera noise — random pixel variations — would otherwise produce false edges. A larger kernel removes more noise but blurs sharp corners; a smaller kernel preserves fine detail but picks up more noise.

**2. Gradient computation** (Sobel operator)

Applies a 3×3 Sobel filter in both X and Y directions to estimate how rapidly pixel intensity changes at each location. The result is a *gradient magnitude* (how strong the edge is) and a *gradient direction* (which way the edge runs).

**3. Non-maximum suppression**

Looks along the gradient direction at each pixel and keeps only the local maximum — i.e. the single pixel where the gradient is strongest across the edge width. Every other pixel on the same edge is set to zero.

This is why Canny edges are always **exactly 1 pixel wide** — a property our pixel-chain extractor relies on.

**4. Hysteresis thresholding** (two-pass)

Two thresholds control which gradient peaks become edges:

| Threshold | Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| High | `CANNY_THRESHOLD_HIGH` | `150` | Above this → strong edge (always kept) |
| Low | `CANNY_THRESHOLD_LOW` | `50` | Between low and high → weak edge (kept only if connected to a strong edge) |

The two-pass approach connects broken edges (which would otherwise stop a robot stroke mid-path) while discarding isolated noise specks that happen to exceed the low threshold.

### From Canny output to robot strokes

The edge image is a binary mask of white pixels on black. We need to turn those scattered pixels into ordered lists (strokes) the robot can trace.

**Why not `cv2.findContours`?**
`findContours` traces the *boundary* of white regions. For a 1-pixel-wide edge, the boundary goes along one side of the pixel and comes back along the other — visiting every pixel twice. The robot would draw each stroke, then retrace it in the opposite direction.

**What we do instead — `_chains_from_edges()`:**
1. Collect all white pixels into a set
2. Pre-compute each pixel's neighbour count; pixels with ≤1 neighbour are *endpoints* (chain tips)
3. Start each new chain from an endpoint (ensuring we begin at a tip, not the middle of a stroke)
4. Walk the chain pixel-by-pixel via 8-connectivity, removing each visited pixel from the set
5. Stop when no unvisited neighbours remain

Result: each pixel is visited exactly once and each chain is an ordered path from one tip to the other.

### Tuning the edge detector

| Goal | What to change |
|------|----------------|
| Fewer edges (less noise) | Increase `CANNY_THRESHOLD_HIGH` |
| Connect broken edges | Decrease `CANNY_THRESHOLD_LOW` |
| Reduce noise (at the cost of fine detail) | Increase `CANNY_BLUR_KERNEL` (must stay odd: 3, 5, 7…) |
| Discard tiny noise fragments | Increase `CONTOUR_MIN_PIXELS` |

## Workflow

### First time

1. **Connect** — enter the robot's IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.100`) and click **Connect**. The status dot turns green.

2. **Workspace setup** — a setup overlay appears.
   - Click **Start Freedrive** — the robot arm goes compliant (you can move it by hand).
   - Physically position the robot's TCP (tool tip) at three reference points on the drawing surface and click **Record** for each:
     - **P0** — the workspace origin (e.g. bottom-left corner of the paper)
     - **Px** — a point along the X direction (e.g. bottom-right corner)
     - **Py** — a point along the Y direction (e.g. top-left corner)
   - Click **Confirm Workspace** — the geometry is saved to `workspace.json` for all future sessions.

3. **Point the camera** at your drawing so it covers the whole paper.

4. **Capture** — click **Capture**. The Canny preview updates live; after capture the 3D viewer shows the extracted path (green = pen-down strokes, grey = pen-up travel segments).

5. **Run** — click **Run**. The robot lifts, travels to the first stroke, and draws. A progress bar tracks execution. Click **Cancel** at any time to stop mid-stroke.

### Subsequent sessions

After the first workspace calibration, a **"Use This Workspace"** banner appears on connect. Click it to skip recalibration and start immediately.

## Architecture notes

### Threading model

Two background daemon threads run alongside the async event loop:

- **`CameraThread`** — continuously reads frames from `cv2.VideoCapture`, encodes two JPEG streams (raw + Canny), and writes them to `shared_state` under `_state_lock`. The MJPEG HTTP endpoints read from `shared_state` at ~30 fps.
- **`PathExecutor`** — runs the per-stroke lift/travel/draw sequence. Long-running RTDE calls (`moveL`, `servoL`) happen here so the WebSocket broadcast loop is never blocked.

All cross-thread communication goes through a single `shared_state: dict` protected by `state_lock: threading.Lock`. The aiohttp event loop offloads blocking calls via `loop.run_in_executor(None, fn)`.

### Workspace calibration

Three robot TCP positions define the drawing surface:

- **P0** — origin
- **Px** — a point along the camera's horizontal axis
- **Py** — a point along the camera's vertical axis

`WorkspaceConfig.from_points()` computes an orthonormal coordinate frame (origin, x-axis, y-axis, z-axis) and the extents in metres. Pixel coordinates are then mapped linearly: `world_x = (u / frame_width) × x_extent`, and the result is expressed in robot base-frame by `p = origin + wx·x̂ + wy·ŷ`.

### Smooth robot motion

Drawing strokes use `servoL` (UR RTDE servo mode) rather than `moveL`:

- Commands stream at **125 Hz** (8 ms timesteps)
- Position is advanced using **arc-length parameterisation** — the robot moves at `DRAW_SPEED` metres per second regardless of waypoint density
- **Smoothstep ease-in/out** (`f(α) = 3α² − 2α³`) is applied to the parameterisation: velocity is 0 at stroke start and end, peaking at 1.5× `DRAW_SPEED` at the midpoint. This eliminates abrupt jerks at pen-down and pen-up transitions.

## Development & testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Unit tests (no hardware required)
pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_integration.py

# With coverage
pytest --cov=. --ignore=tests/test_integration.py

# Integration tests (requires webcam and robot)
export TEST_ROBOT_IP=192.168.1.100
pytest -m integration -v
```

The test suite has **89 unit tests** across four modules:

| Test file | What it covers |
|-----------|---------------|
| `test_path_extractor.py` | Canny pipeline, chain extraction, resampling, TSP ordering, coordinate mapping |
| `test_path_executor.py` | Stroke sequencing, servoL streaming, ease-in/out, progress tracking, cancel |
| `test_robot_controller.py` | RTDE port probe, connect/disconnect, motion commands, thread safety, freedrive |
| `test_camera_thread.py` | Frame capture, dual MJPEG encoding, lock separation |

All unit tests mock hardware (robot and camera) — no physical devices needed.
