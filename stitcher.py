"""
Pure math for Multi-Cam Vision (no hardware, no server).

N RealSense cameras (1 … STITCH_MAX_CAMERAS) look down at the sand from FIXED
mounts. This module lays their frames side by side on one canvas — nothing
more. Per camera: rotate the image to match how it hangs, crop away what is
not sand, then pin the four corners of what is left onto the canvas. The four
corners ARE the placement: sliding all of them moves the camera, turning them
rotates it, pulling one skews it — which is exactly the keystone a camera
mounted at an angle produces. `cv2.warpPerspective` then drops each camera's
depth (and colour) onto the shared grid, and overlapping pixels are averaged.

Same corner-pin convention as the projector calibration in
viewer/projection.html, so the two feel identical: corner order is
**TL, TR, BL, BR** — handles 1, 2, 3, 4.

There is deliberately NO overlap search and no groove detection here. The
cameras are bolted down, so the layout is dialled in once by hand (or loaded
from stitch_calibration.json) and then stays put; detection lives in the main
app, which is the only place its parameters are tuned.

Canvas conventions: millimetres, x right and y down, so v grows down exactly
like the single-camera pipeline. Heightmap values are metres of depth below
the cameras — valleys are larger values, same as raw depth — which keeps the
result a drop-in input for `depth_extractor.grooves_and_mask`.

RGB: the colour stream is aligned to depth per camera, so each depth pixel
carries a colour sample where the (narrower-FOV) RGB lens covers it. Those
ride the same warp; the strips the RGB lenses miss stay black (expected — the
depth image is the product, RGB is reference only).
