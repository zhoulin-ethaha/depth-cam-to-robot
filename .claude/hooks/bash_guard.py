"""PreToolUse hook for the Bash and PowerShell tools.

Blocks obviously destructive commands before they run. This is a SPEED BUMP,
not a security boundary: it matches command strings with regexes, which are
bypassable and can false-positive. On a match it writes the reason to stderr
and exits 2; Claude Code then blocks the call and shows the message, so the
command can be re-run manually if it was actually intended.

Covers both PowerShell (the primary shell on this machine) and Unix / Git-Bash
syntax, and protects this project's runtime state that lives outside git:
the root settings.json (robot IP + projector corners), paths/ (saved
toolpaths) and surfaces/ (uploaded meshes) -- all gitignored, so a stray
recursive delete is unrecoverable.
