"""
Participant-Mode automation state machine.

Participant Mode lives in the ⧉ popup on the Depth viewport: an Auto toggle
arms a depth trigger (a distance in mm from the camera). When anything closer
than the trigger appears in frame the status becomes "Alerted", and once the
frame stays clear for a debounce period the pipeline runs automatically —
Sensing (capture) → Generating Paths → Actuating (save + run). While Auto is
ON the manual Capture/Generate/Run buttons in Developer Mode are locked out.

This module is ONLY the transition logic, so it stays unit-testable: main.py
polls the camera trigger flag, calls ``tick()``, and drives the actual pipeline
(reusing the same handlers as the Developer-Mode buttons) when ``tick`` fires.

Statuses (shown big in the popup, top-right):
  Auto Off          toggle off — popup is just the depth-number viewport
  Auto On           armed, frame clear, watching for something below trigger
  Alerted           something is closer than the trigger
  Sensing           frame cleared — capturing the averaged depth still
  Generating Paths  extracting strokes + projecting the toolpath
  Actuating         saving the bundle and running it on the robot
