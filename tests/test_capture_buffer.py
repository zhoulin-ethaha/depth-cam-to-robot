"""
The rolling buffers Capture averages, and the wait that keeps a hand out of them.

Capture does not use one frame — it averages the last DEPTH_AVERAGE_FRAMES from
each camera. So "wait for the buffer to refill" is what guarantees the picture
the robot draws from does not still contain the participant's hand, or the
projector's light on the sand.

That wait used to be `DEPTH_AVERAGE_FRAMES / DEPTH_FPS`, which is only right
while every camera frame is being caught. Profiling a two-camera rig showed the
buffers filling at 9 fps rather than 30 — the reader was sharing the canvas
loop, and that loop had no time left to spare — so 30 frames spanned 3.3 s while
the code waited 1.3. Two things fix it, and both are tested here: the reader has
its own thread, and the wait is measured from the buffers themselves.

No hardware: the camera thread is driven by writing its buffers directly, which
is exactly what the reader thread does.
